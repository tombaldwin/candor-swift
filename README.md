# candor-swift

**The Swift implementation of [candor-spec](https://github.com/tombaldwin/candor-spec) 0.8** — per-function
side effects (Net/Fs/Db/Exec/Env/Clock/Ipc/Log/Rand/Clipboard), transitively across the call graph, with
the §6.2 policy gate. The fourth engine in the candor family (Rust · JVM · TypeScript · Swift), written
from the spec and validated against the shared conformance oracle: **20/20 on first run**.

```sh
swift build -c release
.build/release/candor-swift <package-dir>            # writes <dir>/.candor/report.<pkg>.Swift.json
                                                     #   + .callgraph.json / .hierarchy.json sidecars
.build/release/candor-swift <dir> --policy gate.pol  # §6.2 deny/pure/allow/forbid; exit 1 on violation
                                                     #   (or CANDOR_POLICY, or a checked-in .candor/config
                                                     #   `policy` line — discovered from the TARGET's
                                                     #   ancestors, never the CWD)
.build/release/candor-swift <dir> --policy gate.pol --gate-json verdict.json
                                                     # + the structured §3.3 verdict {spec, ok, violations}
                                                     #   (`--gate-json -` streams it to stdout)
.build/release/candor-swift --version                # installed build + spec contract (offline) + upgrade line
.build/release/candor-swift --agents                 # the agent contract for THIS build (embedded AGENTS.md)
```

**Staying current:** check your installed version and upgrade — [candor/AGENTS.md §2a](https://github.com/tombaldwin/candor/blob/main/AGENTS.md#2a-staying-current--check-the-version-upgrade). `candor-swift --version` prints the build, the spec, and the upgrade one-liner (offline; candor never phones home).

Built on [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax) — syntactic, like `candor-scan`: no
build of the target needed. Spec obligations carried from day one: universal `hash` emission
(`pkg#qual`, so reports chain as `CANDOR_DEPS` siblings of the other engines), the **κ-coverage ledger**
(`κ doesn't know N modules this code imports…` — unlisted third-party modules are INVISIBLE, not
`Unknown`, and the receipt names them per scan), and the four literal surfaces (`hosts`/`cmds`/`paths`/
`tables`, with the SPEC §2 SQL table extraction token-for-token).

## The trust contract (§4), Swift edition

- A **function-typed value invoked** (`let f: () -> Void` param, a closure-typed field `d.f()`) reads
  `Unknown` — never silent purity. `unknownWhy` names each origin (`callback:f`, `dispatch:Dyn.f`).
- **Dispatch through a local protocol** resolves to the visible conformers when narrow (≤12, the family's
  shared CHA bound) and reads honest `Unknown` otherwise.
- **Closures attribute lexically** (a `DispatchQueue.async { … }` body charges the scheduler — the
  family's closure-attribution rule), and local-receiver method calls resolve through param/let/ctor
  type inference.

## Honest v0 bounds (item 7)

The κ table covers the **platform frontier** (Foundation, Network, Dispatch, os, sqlite3) — third-party
packages contribute nothing and the ledger names them. Nested named functions attribute lexically to
their enclosing unit (an over-approximation, the sound direction). Not yet ported: `CANDOR_DEPS`
consumption (hashes are emitted, so candor-swift reports are already chainable *by* the other engines)
and the read-only queries (§3.1) — consume reports via `candor-query`, which discovers this engine's
`report.<pkg>.Swift.json` + the `hierarchy` sidecar natively. The §7.13 soundness fuzzer **has** landed (`fuzz.py`) — it threads a
known effect through receiver-typing idioms (singletons, fields, collections, casts, enum payloads,
nested receivers) and asserts every reachable function is effect-or-`Unknown`, so the §4 claim here is
now adversarially tested.

## Development

```sh
swift build                  # build → .build/debug/candor-swift
swift test                   # native unit tests (XCTest) over CandorCore: the κ classifier, the SQL/
                             # command/host extractors, the SwiftSyntax type helpers, the propagation fixpoint
bash smoke.sh                # end-to-end (the conformance oracle, the gate, the κ ledger)
python3 fuzz.py              # the §7.13 soundness fuzzer (never silently pure)
python3 fabrication_probe.py # the never-fabricate probe
```

The pure cores live in the **`CandorCore`** library target (unit-tested); the executable imports them.
Compilation is gated by `-warnings-as-errors` (swiftSettings) — compiler warnings are build errors.
